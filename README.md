# MATLAB Biomedical Signal Processing — ECG/EEG

This repository contains a **MATLAB pipeline for ECG signal processing** with toolbox-free implementations, making it portable to any MATLAB installation.  
What makes this repo different: it’s not just about code — it’s also about my journey of learning, problem-solving, and building something I care about as a Biomedical Engineering student.

## Why I Built This

As an aspiring biomedical engineer, I wanted more than just solving textbook problems — I wanted to create something practical that connects **signal processing** with **real-world healthcare applications**.  

I chose ECG analysis because heart monitoring is one of the most fundamental biomedical applications. My goal was to:
- Learn how to preprocess and analyze biosignals.  
- Work around MATLAB toolbox limitations by writing fallback implementations.  
- Gain hands-on coding and GitHub experience for my portfolio.  

This project became both a **technical exercise** and a **personal milestone** — showing how I approach learning by building.

## What I Built

- **Synthetic ECG generator** (runs even if no data file is present)
- **Bandpass filtering**  
  - Butterworth (if available)  
  - Fallback to moving-average filtering if toolboxes aren’t installed
- **Optional 50/60 Hz notch filter** to remove line noise
- **R-peak detection** (via `findpeaks` or custom detector)
- **Heart rate (HR) and HRV metrics** (mean HR, SDNN, RMSSD)
- **Automatic saving of results** to `/figs` and `/data`

---

## How I Completed It

1. **Repo Setup**
   - Created a GitHub repository from scratch.  
   - Learned to use `git add`, `commit`, `push`, and handled conflicts after editing my README online.  
   - Structured the repo into `src/`, `data/`, and `figs/` folders for clarity.

2. **MATLAB Scripts**
   - Started with a simple sine-wave script (`my_first_script.m`) to learn basics.  
   - Built the main ECG pipeline (`ecg_pipeline.m`) to handle filtering, detection, and plotting.  
   - Debugged toolbox dependency issues → rewrote filters using Butterworth + fallbacks.

3. **Running & Testing**
   - Ran the pipeline directly in MATLAB with:  
     ```matlab
     cd src
     ecg_pipeline
     ```  
   - Generated and saved ECG plots + HR results automatically.

4. **Results on GitHub**
   - Pushed code, figures, and README to GitHub.  
   - Learned to include **example plots** inline to make the repo more professional.

## Example Output

## What I Learned

- **MATLAB Signal Processing**  
  How to clean, filter, and analyze ECG signals without relying on premium toolboxes.  
- **Git & GitHub Workflows**  
  From staging files to resolving conflicts, I now understand version control at a deeper level.  
- **Reproducibility & Documentation**  
  Organizing code, saving figures, and writing this README made me think like a researcher and engineer.  
- **Problem-Solving**  
  Every error (missing toolbox, push conflict) was a chance to learn and adapt.

## Future Work

- Extend pipeline to **EEG signal analysis**.  
- Add support for **real-world ECG datasets** (e.g., MIT-BIH arrhythmia database).  
- Compare performance of different filters and detectors.  
- Package the code into functions for easier reuse in larger biomedical projects.
